Based on the following two projects:

1. OpenCC-master
2. opencc-python-master

I created this project for Chinese (Simplified/Traditional) interchange 中文（簡體繁體）互換. 
It applies to an entire directory that contains folders, each with numerous files, All converted in one click.
I am very GRATEFUL to the developers of the above two projects.
Just run StoTdirectory.py in CMD, it will convert everthing in the whole
directory.It will ask user for path of input directory & output directory.

As a matter of fact , all the codes was written by ChatGPT, I only give him the logic.


根據以下兩個項目：

1. OpenCC-master
2. opencc-python-master

我創建了這個項目，用於中文（簡體/繁體）互換 。它適用於包含許多 files 的 folders 的整個 Directory，全部一鍵轉換。
我 (非 常 感 謝) 上述兩個項目的開發者。只需在CMD中運行 StoTdirectory.py，
它會詢問使用者input directory和output directory的 path.

它將轉換整個目錄中的所有內容。事實上，所有的代碼都是由ChatGPT編寫的，我只給他邏輯。
